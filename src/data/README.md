# /data

- This data here is generated from [DesktopFolder's Ranked Query Language](https://github.com/desktopfolder/rankedquerylanguage)
- Every few days, I use RQL to generate a list of all the players to then use for indexing.
- There is a file `helper.js` which helps to convert the data to json and further index it as well.
